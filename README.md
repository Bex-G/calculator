This project was designed as a method to test my understanding of html, CSS and JavaScript to the full exent of my studies to date. 

Once I had the basic logic figured out, I spent most of my time streamlining functionality and reducing the possibility for as many errors as possible. This involved a great deal of troubleshooting and revising my initial processes to get the end result I wanted. 

While I'm sure there are many ways I might have made this easier on myself, regularly tweaking my logic provided an awesome learning opportunity, and I'm pretty proud of how it all turned out!
